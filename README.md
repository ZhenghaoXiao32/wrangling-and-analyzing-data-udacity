# Wrangling and Analyzing Data
This is the wrangle and analyze data project of Udacity's data analyst nano-degree

## Introduction
Data preparation is always the hardest part of a data analyst's work flow, in this project, we will use the data wrangling skills to pull real-world data from Twitter, clean it, and do some analysis. We will get the original Twitter data from Twitter user @dog_rates, along with a image prediction dataset, to build our analysis. 

WeRateDogs is a popular Twitter hash tag, as the name tells, people rate dogs with a denominator of 10 and the numerator is usually higher than 10 to show how lovely the dog is.
