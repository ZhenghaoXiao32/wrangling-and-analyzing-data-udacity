One reason of that is some text contents has multiple number/number format, and the ratings only transform the first number/number into rating numerator and rating denominators which is not the rating but some thing like date/time. Another reason is that some of the of the posted image contains more than one dog, so they will rate 10 dogs based on a denominator of 100. \n",
